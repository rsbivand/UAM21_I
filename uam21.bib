The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
